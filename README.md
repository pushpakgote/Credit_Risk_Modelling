# Credit Default Prediction Notebook

This repository contains a notebook focused on predicting credit default on a highly imbalanced dataset.

## Overview

The notebook analyzes a highly imbalanced dataset to predict credit default. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training and evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this notebook contains information on information such as 'Salary','Automobile_Possession','Two-Wheeler_Ownership' ,'Ongoing_Borrowing' ,'Offspring_Number' ,'Loan_Capital' ,'Borrowing_Periodic_Payment' ,
 'Patron_Academic_Qualification' ,
 'Borrowing_Agreement_Category' ,'Elderliness_in_Days',etc. 
 
 Due to privacy concerns, the actual data isn't included in this repository.

## Dependencies

The notebook utilizes the following libraries:
- Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, etc. 

Make sure to have these installed before running the notebook.

## How to Use

To use the notebook, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Download the dataset or use your own data and update the file path in the notebook.
4. Open the Jupyter notebook.
5. Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to observe the process.

## Notebook Contents

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling, etc.
